## 📌 What is ETL?  

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is a **data integration process** that moves data from multiple sources to a destination (such as a **data warehouse or database**) while ensuring data quality and consistency.  

### 🔹 **ETL Process Steps:**  
1️⃣ **Extract** → Pull raw data from databases, APIs, or cloud applications.  
2️⃣ **Transform** → Clean, standardize, and structure data for analysis.  
3️⃣ **Load** → Store the transformed data into a data warehouse or analytical system.

## 🌟 Why ETL is Important  

🚀 **ETL pipelines** are essential for businesses that rely on **data-driven decisions**. Key benefits include:  

✔️ **Data Centralization** – Integrates data from various sources into one location.  
✔️ **Improved Data Quality** – Cleans, enriches, and structures raw data.  
✔️ **Automation & Scalability** – Reduces manual effort and scales easily.

## 🔄 ETL vs ELT  

| Feature          | ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) | ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Processing**  | Data is transformed before loading | Data is transformed after loading |
| **Best For**    | Traditional data warehouses  | Cloud-native platforms (BigQuery, Snowflake) |
| **Performance** | Slower due to early transformation | Faster due to parallel processing |

ELT is gaining popularity with cloud **data warehouses** like **Snowflake, BigQuery, and Redshift** due to its performance advantages.
